E-commerce Data Analysis Using Python & SQL

Excited to share my recent project where I analyzed an E-commerce dataset using SQL and Python to extract key business insights!

ðŸ”¹ Database Management & Querying: Used SQL to retrieve and manipulate data efficiently.

ðŸ”¹ Data Cleaning & Processing: Handled missing values and inconsistencies for accurate analysis.

ðŸ”¹ Customer & Sales Insights: Analyzed order trends, revenue patterns, and customer behaviors.

ðŸ”¹ Performance Metrics: Computed total sales, average order value, and product demand trends.

ðŸ”¹ Python for Data Visualization: Used Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to present insights visually.

Tech Stack:

âœ… SQL (MySQL/PostgreSQL) â€“ Data extraction & analysis

âœ… Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) â€“ Data manipulation & visualization

This project strengthened my skills in data analysis, business intelligence, and SQL-Python integration for real-world applications.

Would love to connect with professionals in Data Analytics, E-commerce, and Business Intelligence! Letâ€™s discuss insights and industry trends.
